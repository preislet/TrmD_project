## Meet 1 (16.10.2024)
- [x] Random state: 42
- [ ] Keep documentation and comments on point
- [ ] Create workflow diagram
- [ ] How TrmD works + Mechanisms that we want to use
- [ ] Locate binding sites by p2rank
- [ ] Analysis of conformational changes in AHoJ-DB
- [ ] Approaches:
    - small molecules: destabilization of complex, work with Mg+2 (Ca+2, Mn+2), work with knot and AdoMet interaction,
    - proteins: destabilization of complex, mechanical block, PTM, work with C-terminal where tRNA binds (and is similar to Trp repressor),

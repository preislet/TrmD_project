# Structures and work with them


# TrmD
## Interesting structures:
- 4yvi has tRNA bound to it with adomets (Mg2+ is missing)
- 5wyq probably best structure of TrmD with AdoMets (Mg2+ is missing)

## Chai1 generated structure of TrmD with AdoMet and Mg2+
- is in folder called 5wyq_chai1
- The location of Mg2+ ions disagrees with MD simulation discussed in the presentation



# Trm5

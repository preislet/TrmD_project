# Structures and work with them


# TrmD
## Interesting structures:
- 4yvi has tRNA bound to it with adomets (Mg2+ is missing)
- 5wyq probably best structure of TrmD with AdoMets (Mg2+ is missing)

## Chai1 generated structure of TrmD with AdoMet and Mg2+
- is in folder called 5wyq_chai1
- The location of Mg2+ ions disagrees with MD simulation discussed in the presentation

## Pockets
### P2Rank
- [P2Rank of 5wyq](https://prankweb.cz/viewer?id=5wyq&database=v3-conservation-hmm)
  - First 5 pockets make sense as they are the AdoMet pocket with the place for tRNA
  - advised to display the protein as a cartoon with pockets as surfaces
